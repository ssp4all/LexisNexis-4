          "charge_disposition": "Motion to reduce sentence pursuant to 2014 Drug Guidelines Amendment 782 is granted and the defendants previously imposed sentence of imprisonment of 168 months is reduced to 138 months.  ORIGINAL SENTENCE: The dft is hereby committed to the custody of the US Bur of Prisons to be imprisoned for a term of 168 months on Count 1. The dft is remanded to custody of the US Marshal. Upon release from imprisonment, the dft shall be on supervised release for a t erm of 5 yrs. The dft shall pay the following total financial penalties: $50.00 MSA; $2,000.00 FINE. The Court adopts the factual findings &; guideline application in the presentence report except: As findings of fact and sentencing guidelin e calculations the court adopts the uncontested portion of the presentence report &; the contested role in the offense enhancement, but otherwise accepts, for sentencing purposes, the objections to the report made by dft. A review of uncontested porti ons of the report shows that dft had the leading role in the offense, even assuming Luis Hernandez had a role greater than he admits. The sentence is w/in the guideline range, that range does not exceed 24 months, and the sentence is imposed for the following reasons(s): A mid-range sentence is appropirate because the drug trafficking admittedly was more extensive, in time than that for which dft is being held accountable, doubtless was more extensive in amount than the sum used for guideline ca lculations, &; dfts threats do not commend him for lenient treatment."

Dft's involvement in the firearms aspect of the case is similar to that of the codefendants, who do not contest the enhancement. Even if the firearms had a dual purpose, they are part of the drug offense. The court disagrees w /the probation officer's analysis of the criminal history calculation, based on the presentation made at the hearing and will use Category I for Criminal History. The sentence is w/in the guideline range, that range exceeds 24 months, and the se ntence is imposed for the following reason(s): Sentencing at the bottom of the Guidelines reflects dft's more limited role in the offense and is deemed adequate for punishment &; deterrence."
