The Court does not order a fine because the defendant does not have the financial resources or future earning capacity to pay a fine. It is further ordered that the defendant pay a special assessment of $100. It is ordered that upon release from imprisonment the defendant shall be placed on supervised release for a term of 3 years. As a condition of supervised release, upon the completion of the sentence of imprisonment, the defendant shall be surrendered to a duly-authorized immigration official for deportation in accordance with the established procedures provided by the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq. As a further condition of supervised release, if ordered deported or removed, the defendant shall remain outside the United States. The Defendant is remanded to the custody of the US Marshal"
